## Classic Computer Science problems

### Travelling Salesman

- Web Map Project: a web page with a map, and you can click on the map to add locations that will be visited by the salesman. You need to set a start and an end, and they can be the same location. The algorithm calculates and shows the shortest route with absolute distances between locations. But be careful: with 12 or more locations, it will take exponencially a long time. In my computer:
   - 3 to 10 locations: less than 1 second
   - 11 locations: 2 seconds
   - 12 locations: 36 seconds
   - 13 locations: 7 minutes and 49 seconds
   - 14 locations: I didn't even try!
- Multithreading in Python: soon!
